# crytoGolf

# Project Description
This project represents a group effort to create a physics-based golf game, with a twist:<br>
the terrain is generated based on the ups and downs of the cryptocurrency market.<br>

The project was conceived and organized by Chandler Dibble;<br>
it was developed by a four-person team over one week.<br>
The total time spent developing our project, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at 120+ hours.<br>

We primarily utilized Javascript with Matter.js and Express.js.<br>
HTML and CSS were deliberately de-emphasized to allow us to generate our images, shapes, etc. with Javascript.<br>
This is reflected in contributors' roles all including "back-end" work.<br>
Bitfinex's API was utilized to provide our cryptocurrency exchange data, with which we generated our terrain.<br>
Heroku was also utilized for the first time by group members, as previous projects were hosted solely on Github Pages.<br>
Significant time was devoted to learning Matter.js and implementing ES6, with which we were unfamiliar but eager to practice.<br>

Internally, we needed to generate a basic world and physics-based parameters for our game.<br>
Objects such as a golf ball were created and assigned values to allow their proper interaction.<br>
Functions were written to generate our objects, cause them to interact, and influence the manner in which they interacted.<br>
The bitfinex API was called in order to generate the ground on which golf was played.<br>

Each project member spent time learning how to implement Matter.js and ES6.<br>
[additional info on what we do].<br>
Expertise on cryptocurrencies was provided by Tim Hill.<br>

Our project is hosted through Github Pages at: https://xhandler.github.io/cryptoGolf/,<br>
and through Heroku at: [add when hosted]<br>

## How to Use
The user will need to clone a copy of our repo.<br>
Then, he or she should open the index.html file in a browser of their choice.<br>
The user will then play through a pretty straight-forward game of golf, with a few twists.<br>

To start, the user will [].<br>
It might also help to pray for a stable month in the crypto markets.<br>
From here, just swing away!<br>

## Notes
Our initial project idea was to create a Rube Goldberg game;<br>
it became apparent that this wouldn't be viable within the timeframe we allotted ourselves.<br>

Future work on rubegoldberg, collaborative or independent, is possible.<br>

## Inspirations
Desert Golfing served as our initial inspiration;<br>
the idea of combining this with cryptcurrency was provided by Tim Hill.<br>
